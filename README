# BPM Detector

A BPM(beats per minute) detection tool that can give you the tempo of any given song using Kotlin.

You need the following library to make it work:
- `jaad`
- `TarsosDSP`

Currently I just support to detect BPM of any song in AAC(.m4a) format. Will support more formats in the future.
