# BPM Detector

A BPM(beats per minute) detection tool that can give you the tempo of any given song using Kotlin.

You need the following library to make it work:
- `jaad`
- `TarsosDSP`

Use `AudioProcessor` to process all the supported format on your computer (as long as you have corresponding ffmpeg decoders).
